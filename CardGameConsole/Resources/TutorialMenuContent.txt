Tutorial
-----------------------
This game is a simplified variant of the classic five card stud.

At the start of the round, each player is dealt five cards after they have anteed $1 and are alotted $100.

During the betting round(s), each player bets $1 and all bets will be added to the pot. 

After the betting round, each player has the chance to trade in up to 3 cards. When prompted to do so by the dealer,
enter the positions of the cards (1 - 5) you wish to discard separated by a space.

The final betting round will start after the trade-ins and after the bets are placed, each player will reveal their hand.

The winner, to whom goes the spoils, is determined by the highest ranking poker hand or in the event of the tie, the most valuable high card.

The following are the poker hand rankings listed in order of most importance:
	Royal Flush - Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 all in the same suit.
	Straight Flush - Five cards in a sequence, all in the same suit.
	Four of a Kind - All four cards of the same rank.
	Full House - Three of a kind with a pair.
	Flush -Any five cards of the same suit but not in a sequence.
	Straight - Five cards in a sequence but not of the same suit.
	Three of a Kind - Three cards of the same rank.
	Two Pair - Two different pairs.
	One Pair - Two cards of the same rank. 
	High Card - When you haven't made any of the hands above, the highest card plays.
