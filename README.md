This poker game started out as a final project for my object-oriented programming course. The original project (see class diagram below) did not follow SOLID principles so I refactored the structure to better follow said principles. I also incorporated some unit testing into my project. 

I'm still working on additional refactorings.

## Playing The Game

To play the game you need to [download](https://github.com/asathkumara/CSharp-Poker-Game/releases/download/v4.5/CSharp-Poker-Game-v4.5.zip) the release, extract it and run the setup.exe file.
