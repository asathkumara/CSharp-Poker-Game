# CSharp-Poker-Game ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-green.svg)
This poker game started out as a final project for my object-oriented programming course. I improved the original project by refactoring the structure and the logic; and by incorporating C# constructs such as LINQ, and some unit tests. 

I'm still working on additional refactorings.

## Playing The Game 
To play the game you need to [download](https://github.com/asathkumara/CSharp-Poker-Game/releases/download/v3.0/CSharp-Poker-Game-v3.0.zip) the release, extract it and run the setup.exe file.
