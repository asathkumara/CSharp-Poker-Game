## Introduction
This project started out as a final for my object-oriented programming course. The original project (see [diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28933557/55295035-a42f5300-53bd-11e9-9e35-bb40800ca181.JPG)) did not follow the SOLID principles so I refactored the structure. I also incorporated some unit testing into my project. 

I'm currently exploring additional refactorings, if you have some ideas / feedback, I'd like to hear it.

## Playing The Game

To play the game you need to [download](https://github.com/asathkumara/CSharp-Poker-Game/releases/download/v4.5/CSharp-Poker-Game-v4.5.zip) the current release, extract it and run the setup.exe file. You may get a false positive for the `.exe` but that is to be expected since it isn't digitally signed.
